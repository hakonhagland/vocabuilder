Creating backup
===============

Your database is backed up to a local git repository when you start the app
or when you click the ``Backup`` button. From the backup repository you can
recovery any earlier state of your vocabulary database.

Extension to `firebase <https://firebase.google.com/>`_ cloud backup is planned.
